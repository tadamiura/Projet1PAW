            <h2>Cupcake</h2>
            <p>The term cupcake is first mentioned in the book "E. Leslieâ€™s Receipts" published in 1828. The cupcake is a cake which then became very popular in the 1950s. It was originally the cake for housewives. Others believe that its name comes from the unit of measure cup, in the imperial and American systems of measurement, based on volume and not weight. Later, they were also known as "number cake" or "1234 cake", due to the easy-to-remember traditional dough recipe, namely: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour and four eggs.</p>
